Big Objects
	There are two types of big objects.
	Standard big objects—
Objects defined by Salesforce and included in Salesforce products. FieldHistoryArchive is a standard big object that stores data as part of the Field Audit Trail product. Standard big objects are available out of the box and cannot be customized.
	Custom big objects—New objects that you create to store information unique to your org. Custom big objects extend the functionality that Lightning Platform provides. For example, if you’re building an app to track product inventory, create a custom big object called HistoricalInventoryLevels to track historical inventory levels for analysis and future optimizations. This implementation guide is for configuring and deploying custom big objects.
