Failure at Jackson - April 2021.
	- Release lead for a major insurance client with more than 600 users.
	  More than 25 team members from two different teams.
	  It was a first combined release so we were struggling with a lot of things to get right.
	  I had a story to make folders private. Updated 20 something permissions to remove it.
	  However, I promoted the changes from my personal to higher environments.
	  Everything was tested and QA passed.
	  But, after prod deployment, there were several inquiries about permission sets.
	  We had to fix them manually.

  	  Permission Sets are sensitive.


	- There was a story to make folders private by one group. There were several groups in the company.
	  Worked with their two different analysts and QA team.
	  Demoed it in a demo meeting attended by 50 different people but not all the users.
	  It was rolled out the same day.
	  Next day, flooded with several inquiries about folders and dashboards with reports not being visible.	

Lessons learned
	- Write test classes for each permission set.
	- Run all the test classes.


	**May 2021**
	- Working on a Lead Conversion Tasks
		Turned Lead Setting Enforce Rules setting off
		Converted leads using a batch job
		Updated them to certain record types
		Forgot to turn on the enforce rules setting.
		There was already an automated Lead Conversion job.
			That converted 2000 leads which were not supposed to be converted.
