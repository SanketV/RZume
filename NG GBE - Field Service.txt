Field service management (FSM) refers to the management of a company's resources employed at or en route to the property of clients, rather than on company property. Examples include locating vehicles, managing worker activity, scheduling and dispatching work, ensuring driver safety, and integrating the management of such activities with inventory, billing, accounting and other back-office systems. FSM most commonly refers to companies who need to manage installation, service or repairs of systems or equipment. It can also refer to software and cloud-based platforms that aid in field service management.

Field service management helps organizations manage work tasks
of any kind that need to be performed on location. Field service is
a collaboration between numerous parties, including:
	• The customer who makes the service request or product that
	requires support;
	• The agent who receives the service request and creates a work
	order;
	• The dispatcher who ensures that the right work is assigned to
	the right mobile employee based on schedules, expertise, and
	location; and
	• The mobile employee who receives the work order and makes
	the on-site visit to complete the job.

	While field service depends on many different factors, at the end
	of the day, you’re measured on the quality of the individual service
	you provide to each and every customer.
