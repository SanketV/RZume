- Difference between Workflow and Process.

- When to use Process, Workflow and Apex Triggers?  

- What is the function of Organization-Wide Sharing Defaults

- Types of sandboxes - Developer, Developer Pro, Partial, Full Sandbox

- Purpose of Record Types (Assign different business processes, picklist values and layouts)

- Order of Trigger Execution

-Can you customize Apex & Visualforce directly in a production org?
	Apex cannot be customised in a production Org, it must be changed and deployed through a sandbox and meet test coverage. 
	Visualforce, on the other hand, may be customized directly in production (Although this is not a best practice)

- Relationships in Salesforce
	- Lookup
	- Master-Detail
	- Many to many (Junction object)

- What are Governor Limits?
	Total number of records retrieved by a SOQL query – 50,000
	Total number of SOQL queries issued – 100 (Synchronous) 200 (Asynchronous)
	Total number of DML statements issued – 150
	Total number of callouts (HTTP requests or Web services calls) in a transaction – 100
	Maximum CPU time on the Salesforce servers – 10,000ms (Synchronous) 60,000ms (Asynchronous)

- What do you like about Salesforce and what do you not like?

- Deployment / What's the Release process? [How do you track changes?]

- Bulkification / Handler / Loops
	 [Describe a scenario where you cannot use INNER JOINS]

- Static variable in Salesforce APEX vs in C#/Java

- Agile Methodology

- What are External ID fields used for?
	Certain fields can be defined as an external ID on an object. These can be used in order to match up data from external systems with a unique reference ID. For example, if you need to match up data from an external accounting system to the Accounts in Salesforce, you can use an external ID field to reference the Accounting systems unique ID instead of the Salesforce ID.

- What is the difference between public and global class in Apex?
	Global class is accessible across the Salesforce instance irrespective of namespaces.
	Whereas, public classes are accessible only in the corresponding namespaces.

- How to create a batch file in Apex

	Database.Batchable interface contains three methods that must be implemented:

	Start method:
		global (Database.QueryLocator | Iterable<sObject>) start(Database.BatchableContext bc) {}
	Execute method:
		global void execute(Database.BatchableContext BC, list<P>){}
	Finish method:
		global void finish(Database.BatchableContext BC){}


• Apex Best Practices •
	1. Bulkify your code
	2. Avoid SOQL or DML statements inside FOR Loops
	2. Bulkify Helper methods
	3. Use Collections and streamline queries
	4. Avoid hard coding ids. e.g. record types
	5. One trigger per object
	6. Query large data set in For Loop
	7. Use Apex Governor Limit class to handle errors.


-----------------------------------

For example, you can use custom metadata types for the following.

Mappings—Create associations between different objects, such as a custom metadata type that assigns cities, states, or provinces to particular regions in a country.
Business rules—Combine configuration records with custom functionality. Use custom metadata types along with some Apex code to route payments to the correct endpoint.

Master data—Let’s say that your org uses a standard accounting app. Create a custom metadata type that defines custom charges, like duties and VAT rates. If you include this type as part of an extension package, subscriber orgs can reference the master data.

Whitelists—Manage lists, such as approved donors and pre-approved vendors.

Secrets—Store information, like API keys, in your protected custom metadata types within a package.

Custom metadata rows resemble custom object rows in structure. You create, edit, and delete custom metadata rows in Metadata API or in Setup. Because the records are metadata, you can migrate them using packages or Metadata API tools.
